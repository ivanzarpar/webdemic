        <p class="texto"><b>SEO</b> (search engine optimization acronyms) are all techniques or actions aimed at increasing the traffic of a website thanks to improving its positioning in the different search engines (especially Google, the king of search engines, but also others such as Bing or Yahoo). Its main objective is to increase visibility; what's the same, that more visits come to a website.</p>

      <h2>The Past</h2>
      <div id="past" class="containerTextIndex" style="margin-bottom: 3em;">
        <div class="boxImage" style="float: right; margin-left: 50px; margin-top: -1em;">
    	    <img src="./images/seo2.png" alt="SEO" style="width:100%;" />

    	    </div>
    	  </div>
        <p class="texto"><b>In the beginning</b>, all web page administrators had to do was send the address of a web page, or URL, to the different engines, which would send a web spider or web crawler to inspect that site, extract links to other pages that had that website and return the collected information to be indexed. The process involves a web spider belonging to the search engine, which downloads a page and stores it on the company's servers, where a second program, known as an indexer, extracts information about the page. Among it, the words it contains and where they are located, the relevance of specific words and all the links contained in the page, which are stored to be later tracked by the web spider. The birth of Google, in 1998, changed this and so what we know as SEO was born. Factors external to the page (PageRank and link analysis) were considered as internal factors (keyword frequency, meta tags, headers, links and website structure, page loading speed), to allow Google to avoid type of manipulation seen in search engines that only considered internal factors of the page for classifications.</p>

      <h2>In the last decade</h2>
      <div id="present" class="containerTextIndex" style="margin-bottom: 3em;">
        <div class="boxImage" style="float: right; margin-left: 50px;">
          <img src="./images/seo3.png" alt="SEO" style="width:100%;" />
          <div class="container">
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">SEO <em>(Present)</em></p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p class="texto"><b>In the last decade</b>, Google Instant, real-time search, has been of great importance in an attempt to make the search results more relevant and recent. Historically, web administrators have spent months or even years optimizing a website to improve its positioning. With the rise in popularity of social media and blogs, major engines made changes to their algorithms to allow for fresh content and quickly position search results. In addition, Google implemented the "Panda" update, which penalizes websites that contain duplicate content from other sites and sources. Historically, web pages have copied content from others benefiting from the classification of search engines by applying this technique, however Google implemented a new system in which it penalizes web pages whose content is not unique. Also the "Penguin" update aimed at penalizing those sites that used manipulative techniques to improve their rankings. (SEO Spam or Web Spam).</p>

      <h2>The future</h2>
      <div id="future" class="containerTextIndex">
        <div class="boxImage" style="float: right; margin-left: 50px; margin-top: -1em;">
    	    <img src="./images/seo4.png" alt="SEO" style="width:100%;" />
    	    <div class="container">
    		  <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">SEO <em>(Future)</em></p>
    	    </div>
    	  </div>
        <p class="texto"><b>The future</b> is difficult to predict, but the most immediate goes through voice assistants that allow users to perform an Internet search when asking a question verbally. Some of the best known are: Alexa, Siri, Google Now and Cortana. These can be controlled via a smartphone and also be present in our home by voice devices, such as Amazon Echo, even integrated into a Smart TV. The increase in this search methodology, from the SEO point of view, means that we should focus on thinking about the intent of the user's voice search. We must bear in mind that people do not speak the same way we write, that searches that are carried out through verbal communication are longer and more natural phrases than those we use in written communication. This brings about a radical change in implementing an SEO strategy. It means that we will go from conducting a traditional keyword study focused on searching as a traditional user would on their pc or mobile, to performing a Search Intent Voice. The use of long tail in SEO will become more relevant due to their use in conversational searches.</p>
